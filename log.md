## Code Challenge

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

## Code Challenge Solution

```js
function squareDigits(num){
  const str = num.toString();
  let newNum = '';
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    newNum += (parseInt(str[i]) ** 2);
  }
  return parseInt(newNum);
}
```

## Thoughts

Originally, I converted num to a string and then used .split('') but it returned an object and not an array.  When researching why, I learned that the output of String.prototype.split is an Array and that is an Object.

So I just used a for loop, stored it in a new variable, and then converted it to a number.
